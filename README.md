<label>In this project i have used Numpy,Seaborn,matplotlib,Pandas,sklearn and xgboost</label>
We differentiate Numerical And Categorical Values
Handle Missing values in case of numericaal data we use mean
  and for categorical data we use mode to replace the missing values.
Then perform some data analysis, found distribution plots of numerical values and 
count plots for categorical values.
After that, we perform label encoding to convert categorical values into numerical values.
Then, data is splited into features and targets.
Then, splited into training and testing data.
And train our model with the help of XGBoost Regressor.
Using this training data, we have tested it based with r2 value
